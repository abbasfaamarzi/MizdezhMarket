The password format should include the following characters based on the `check_password_strength` function:

1. At least one digit, for example: "5"
2. At least one uppercase letter, for example: "Q"
3. At least one lowercase letter, for example: "z"
4. At least one special character if the length is greater than or equal to 8, for example: "@"
5. At least 8 characters long, for example: "p@ssWord-019W"

The `check_password_strength` function checks if the password meets these criteria. If the password meets all the criteria, it returns "Password is strong!". Otherwise, it returns an error message indicating which criteria the password does not meet.    
For Ex:
"P@ssword1234"

Economic & Social Network of Cinix Digital Currency System

The Economic Network of Cinix Digital Currency System aims to provide a secure and transparent platform for digital currencies and offers a variety of free services to its users. In this system, the Cinix proprietary currency is distributed to users based on voting and verification accuracy.

One of the services provided by this network is the ability for users to produce and sell content. Users can create short articles with a unique and distinctive title and sell them on the platform.

Additionally, this network allows users to submit their ideas for the development of transaction service software. Based on a public account called "Rosta Bank Account," which adds some money for each bank transaction, currency is allocated to users whose ideas have received more likes.

In this network, users can also participate in public voting on issues such as today's exchange rate to the dollar, the number of coins that should be produced in a time interval, the amount of time to allocate for mining, or the profit on their deposits in the network. All transactions in this network are performed using the user's private key and password, and no information about any user is stored anywhere.

In conclusion, this system can be one of the great guarantees for democracy in the future.

about_private_key = '''
The Private Key is one of the most important components of a personal digital identity used for encrypting information and verifying identity. It is used for digitally signing information, authentication, secure communication with online services, validation, and more.

Keeping the Private Key secure is crucial, and any security flaw can lead to unauthorized access to your personal and financial information. The best way to keep the Private Key secure is to use strong encryption methods such as RSA and AES and store it in an environment that is protected against attacks, including phishing attacks, virus attacks, and hacking attacks. It is also best to always keep your Private Key in a secure environment without an internet connection and avoid sending it to others over the internet.
